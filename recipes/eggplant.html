    <h3>Image of the finished Eggplant Lasagna!</h3>
        <p>This recipe is a pretty standard lasagna recipe, except it uses eggplant in place of the pasta! Very good for people who are trying to limit their carbs.</p>

            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil for brushing</li>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Oil 2 baking sheets and a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and water together in a shallow dish. Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, salt, and ground black pepper in a separate shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Dip eggplant slices into egg mixture, then press each gently into bread crumb mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake eggplant slices in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove eggplant from the oven and increase temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season beef with salt and ground black pepper. Stir tomato sauce into ground beef; bring to a simmer and set sauce aside.</li>
            <li>Place 1/3 of the eggplant slices on bottom of the dish. Pour 1/3 of tomato sauce with ground beef on top of eggplant layer. Sprinkle 1/3 of mozzarella cheese on top of sauce layer.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
